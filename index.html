    <h2>The start of the story</h2>
    <p>This is a story all about how my life got flip turned upside down and I'd like to take a minute so just sit right there and I'll tell you the story of how I became the Fresh Prince of Bel Air</p>
    <h2>The middle of the story</h2>
    <p>In West Philadelphia born and raised, on the playground was where I spent most of my days, chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool and all shooting some b ball outside of the school, til a couple of guys who were up to no good, started making trouble in my neighbourhood. I got in one little fight and my mum got scared, she said "you're moving to auntie and uncles in Bel Air"</p>
    <h2>The end of the story</h2>
    <p>I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said 'fresh' and it had dice in the mirror, if anything I could say to this cab was rare, but I thought "Nah forget it, Yo home to Bel Air." I pulled up to the house about seven or eight and I yelled to the cabby "yo homes smell you later", looked at my kingdom I was finall there to sit on my throne as the Fresh Prince of Bel Air </p>
